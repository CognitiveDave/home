## From YouTube Video blogging back to Hashnode
My last post discussed a potential transition from Blogging to VBlogging. "Having spent time writing on platforms such as Medium and WordPress I have decided to also branch out into Video. Learning how to put together a video is a new experience for me.  To help me learn I created a series ['Technology is Human innovation in Action'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKfduR7k-TQI0MJl209k2A) over on YouTube." 

### Creating the 'Technology is Human innovation in action' series

Creating the series and recording an entire application build,  adding streaming analytics,  and doing analysis of data in motion was fun but also challenging and stressful.  Moving beyond the series was a choice between doing another series or returning to blogging.   Some of the concepts involved are difficult to explain in a short video sequence so I returned to blogging in the end.

### CognitiveDave's view - yet another blog
I noticed that [Hashnode](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/) emerged as a new platform for Developers to Blog.  It lacks the Medium paywall and commericalism involved.  I instantly liked Hashnode it just felt built for bloggers.  Exploring the platform sort of encouraged a new series associated with the video series.

#### Statistics
I wrote a short series of posts about Time Series statistics

[Technology is human innovation in action](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/technology-is-human-innovation-in-action-cke35vx3l017igws1g4uffgvw)
Welcome to my new blog and site here on Hashnode. My intention is to use the site in conjunction with my YouTube channel to share information, insights, and tutorials on some of the projects I do in my field.

[Statistics can be our friend!](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/statistics-can-be-our-friend-cke74tpk801anyjs16kjza58w)
Statistics can be our friend, but I have struggled to make statistics meaningful or rather to use statistics. In this short article, I will illustrate some uses of statistics in the Internet of Things and streaming measurements from Environment sensors. To introduce the techniques, I have to provide some insight into the capture device and then move onto the actual statistics. So let us start with Data Capture and then move to the Analytics.

[Getting information from Sensor readings](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/getting-information-from-sensor-readings-ckefk64xc01d198s1bwsihlp3)
In my last article, Statistics can be our friends, I started the process of defining meaning from streaming sensor readings. In this article, I propose to continue the exploration of the sensor data through statistics. I demonstrated some applications of the estimate of location and will continue to develop those ideas in this edition.

[Statistics can be useful](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/statistics-can-be-useful-ckefug7a7005yo5s16tdjfbv5)
Continuing the series, we are working with Statistics to make sense of my recent Home Sensor Network build.

[What is all this talk about Variability?](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/what-is-all-this-talk-about-variability-ckegx979m01ch42s12ofeadd5)
So we continue the series of exploring Sensor data with statistics. Today's article is all about variability. In the previous articles, I have sought to show the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the need to investigate and understand the data. Boxplots and other visualisations are extremely useful to aid that understanding. So far, we decided that 22degrees centigrade is an ideal average ambient indoor temperature for me. We will start with defining variability, then move on to how it can be used, and close with some computations of the variances in my data.

[More variance talk](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/more-variance-talk-ckeipisz100iymts1bnjmcsph)
We need to talk about estimating variance some more. In the last article, I introduced the concepts but stated that variance estimates for time series data are troublesome. In previous articles, I developed an estimate of location, dealt with outliers and missing values. The average was 22degrees centigrade and, I had pictures of things in my life supporting that value for Indoor temperature preference. In this article, I will do some variance computations, and look at some graphs that help us make sense of the variances in our data.

[Relationships between variables](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/relationships-between-variables-ckeixdfxm003f1vs1h0nma5mb)
We continue to do our exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Sensor Data project. So far we have covered generating estimates of location and variability in our data. In this article, we will do some more exploration and look at the relationship between variables.

[Exploratory data analysis is important](https://cognitivedave.hashnode.dev/exploratory-data-analysis-is-important-ckejy6ld7007wh9s17gujeb39)
We have been discussing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) in this series of articles. So far it has been mostly about hacking out code. Making visuals, and using libraries. Surely, you should be shouting, there must be a better approach. Are there tools that can just do this for us? If you are shouting and pleading for a low code or no-code solution then thankfully there are plenty. Let's go explore!


## Github pages
My experience with Hashnode is just so much different than Github Pages.  Personally I recommend Medium or Hashnode for any meaningful writing.  Github pages is great but it is limited.
