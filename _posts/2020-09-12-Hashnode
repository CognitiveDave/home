## From Blogging to Video
Having spent time writing on platforms such as Medium and WordPress I have decided to also branch out into Video. Learning how to put together a video is a new experience for me.  To help me learn I created a series ['Technology is Human innovation in Action'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKfduR7k-TQI0MJl209k2A) over on YouTube.

### Technology is Human innovation in action

I guess every show has a show title,  has episodes,  and has opening and closing art work.  I found the opening image using Microsoft PowerPoint.  Buying some music tracks allows me to have an opening and closing theme song.

### Episodes
The plan is to produce a set of videos that explains large projects.  The current project is 'building a sensor network' and I already have the following episodes published with more to come:-

1 [Smart Home - Sensors - Part 1 - DIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvVc7LjmUT0)

2 [sensor build part 2 - Slide show building sensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw3n4q64bIg)

3 [Building the Sensor network - part 2 - Hardware discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGHaCjhOGKQ)

4 [Building the sensor network part 3 - Software Macro level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n4FwgpvXSM)

5 [Understanding how to set-up a Sensor - defining a Client Side program](https://youtu.be/_OuI89TxLjE)

6 [Understanding how to set-up a Consumer - and push readings to a database](https://youtu.be/_OuI89TxLjE)

7 [Understanding how to perform Analytics](https://youtu.be/ZjvuDGqRLoY)

8 [Designing and building a User Interface for the project](https://youtu.be/0btwyE1NO-8)

9 [Bringing the whole project together](https://youtu.be/xZXdYkbPi7Y)

10 The closing project retrospective. Since the build completed July 2020 I am now harvesting data to do further analysis before concluding on the whole exercise.

The whole series is now one [play list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_7kiTrbF7bggIoU3ESx_5CAdZrA7Nr_V)

### Learning to make videos
Since I am learning to make videos the episodes should improve in both narrative and content as I go along.  There is no attempt here to polish or reach perfection.  Perfection is unnecessary in a learning curve.  I have little interest in followers, subscribers though if folk wish to do so and wish to contribute that is also fine.  There is no sponsorship and everything in these videos is a personal opinion.  Tools and techniques used are choosen to match the specific project. I highly recommend taking professional approaches to IT Security, Data Privacy, Resiliency,  Accessibility,  and Usability of all products.

## Learning through Projects and fun
Trust me when I say - you will not learn from MOOC,  books,  videos,  or courses.  You will learn from practice.  So go ahead and do some projects and learn some stuff today.
