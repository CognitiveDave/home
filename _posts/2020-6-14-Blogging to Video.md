## From Blogging to Video
Having spent time writing on platforms such as Medium and WordPress I have decided to also branch out into Video. Learning how to put together a video is a new experience for me.  To help me learn I created a series ['Technology is Human innovation in Action'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKfduR7k-TQI0MJl209k2A) over on YouTube.

### Technology is Human innovation in action

I guess every show has a show title,  has episodes,  and has opening and closing art work.  I found the opening image using Microsoft PowerPoint.  Buying some music tracks allows me to have an opening and closing theme song.
