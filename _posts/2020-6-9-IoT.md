![A collage of David's temperature experiment](/images/20200609_101312-COLLAGE.jpg)

Internet of Things has been a key interest for me for a long time. The small Raspberry Pi board is ideal for building up experiments and connecting up devices.  Shown in the image is a Raspberry Pi 4,  USB boot,  with the Sense Hat board installed.  

### Python iot.py
A small script called [iot.py](https://github.com/CognitiveDave/Sensors/blob/master/iot.py) takes a reading from the temperature sensor displaying that on the LED display and making a data record of each reading.  The script has the following functions:-

1. sense_display(int) A small function to paint the reading onto the Sense Hat Led. [Derived from](https://pythonicpi.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/temperature-display-on-sensehat/);
2. getCPUtemperature() calls vcgencmd to get core temperature. [more here](https://elinux.org/RPI_vcgencmd_usage);
3. getCPUclock() similar use of vcgencmd;
4. getCPUvolts() similar use of vcgencmd;
5. getfree_mem() ditto;
6. getfree_memGPU() ditto 

The rest of the code serves to set-up a loop that reads the sensors every 60 seconds, paints the reading on the LED and creates a data record which is printed to console and written to a file.

```
while (temp > 0):
 text_file = open("/home/pi/Desktop/TempLog.log","a")
 temp = round(sense.get_temperature_from_humidity(),2)
 temp_pressure = round(sense.get_temperature_from_pressure(),2)
 humidity = round(sense.get_humidity(),2)
 pressure = round(sense.get_pressure(),2)
 time_now = time.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")

 cpu = getCPUtemperature()
 cpu_speed = getCPUclock()
 cpu_volts = getCPUvolts()
 mem = getfree_mem()
 memGPU = getfree_memGPU ( )
 cpu_up = datetime.now() - tstart
 outline = "R, {x} ,{a} ,{b} ,{c} ,{e} ,{g} ,{i} ,{h} ,{m} ,{n} ,{u}".format(a=temp, b=temp_pressure, c=humidity, e=pressure , x=time_now , g=cpu , i=cpu_volts, h=cpu_speed, m=mem, n=memGPU, u=cpu_up )
 
 print (outline )
 text_file.write(outline + "\n")
 text_file.close()
 sense_display(temp - 22)
 sleep(60)
 sense.clear()
``` 
### Conclusion
A simple project that illustrates some of the features of Internet of Things and working with sensors.

#### Notes
1. [Data sheet for Raspberry Pi Sense Hat](http://www.wecl.com.hk/distribution/PDF/RaspberryPi/58-32-5300.pdf) 
2. You must edit the /boot/config.txt and add dtoverlay=rpi-sense then reboot. Otherwise the Sense Hat is not detected
