### My Interests
As a Technologist, I am interested in all aspects of the human experience at work using Technology. Smart building systems, carefully designed workspaces, and appropriately equipped collaborative spaces make a real difference to creativity and innovation at work. However, Technology must fade into the background.  I have spent an entire career dealing with technology problems with things not working, people using low powered cheap off-the-shelf laptop computers, small screens,  and underpowered servers making people miserable. Things are improving the past few years with everything getting more powerful.

These days we have to define what we mean by work.  For me, it is about any time I sit down to figure out something, attend a call,  make a pitch.  I do not refer to 'Work from Home', or 'In the Office', these are becoming irrelevant terms.  With mobile Technology the Car, Airport,  or Hotel are equally good workspaces in their contexts.

I maintain an active interest in the following topics going back to the 1980's:-

1. Software Engineering - Now more than ever, the world is defined by Software. I have learned many languages ranging from the low-level assembly, C for embedded systems,  through Java,  R and Python.  Indeed I have created many full-stack web applications and am proficient in Front end and Back end development.
2. Devices at work - The device must be designed to fade away and allow work. Over the years, I used Mac, Windows, and Linux at work.  I find that operating systems are mostly the same at the end of the day and tend to fade away. I'm not too fond of updates, crashes,  error messages, hangs, freezes etc.  because those disrupt the thought process.  These things happen because of a lack of resources.  I have assembled several different computer systems specifically to ensure that the device performs and fades into the background.  Generally, fast storage, plenty of fast memory, and everything operating to a maximum frequency makes a pretty damn good computer.
3. Experiences at work - User Experience,  HCI,  Design
4. Innovation - Design Thinking and solving problems.
5. Technology trends and evolution of Technology. Blockchain, AI,  connected IoT and many others.
6. Data - if Software is defining the World,  Data is describing it.
7. Visualization techniques to surface insights and aid in human cognition at work.

I believe these interests are the relevant skills for the future.
