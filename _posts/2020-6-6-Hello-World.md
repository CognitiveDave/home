### My Interests
As a Technologist, I am interested in all aspects of the human experience at work using Technology. Smart building systems, carefully designed workspaces, and appropriately equipped collaborative spaces make a real difference to creativity and innovation at work. However, Technology must fade into the background.  I have spent an entire career dealing with technology problems with things not working, people using low powered cheap off-the-shelf laptop computers, small screens,  and underpowered servers making people miserable. Things are improving the past few years with everything getting more powerful.

These days we have to define what we mean by work.  For me, it is about any time I sit down to figure out something, attend a call,  make a pitch.  I do not refer to 'Work from Home', or 'In the Office', these are becoming irrelevant terms.  With mobile Technology the Car, Airport,  or Hotel are equally good workspaces in their contexts.
