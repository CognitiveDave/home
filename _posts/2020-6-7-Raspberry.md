## How much does a Raspberry Pi 4B Computer actually cost
Recently I read quiet a few articles suggesting a **Raspberry Pi computer** is like $35 USD.  I thought really how could that be? 
So naturally I made a Spreadsheet using Office365 Online directly from my Raspberry Pi 4.  Here is what I found!

### What is a computer System
The first thing we need to be really clear on is what we actually mean by a Computer System.  Since that would be somewhat tedious to describe 
I just went out and grabbed the first decent definition I found by asking GOOGLE.

"A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster." [Wikipedia June 7, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)

So we need:-
1. Hardware;
2. Software;
3. Peripheral equipment

#### Hardware
Hardware typically includes an array of components. Here is a typical list:-

1. A computer case or enclosure;
2. A power supply - hopefully matched to the maximum power draw of the full system;
3. A CPU cooler generally speaking a number of fans,  sometimes included in the case;
4. Computer storage - RAID - mSata, SSD, or mechanical drives are all popular;
5. A motherboard or the actual computer board;
6. Increasingly more important is a solid GPU or even multiple GPU with a bridge


The Raspberry Pi 4 motherboard starts at $35 dollars.  That is true but that is just the motherboard.

Typically you need to buy a kit such as the CanaKit shown

[CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 4GB Starter Kit - 4GB RAM](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07XH3HWTQ/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+4b&qid=1591541258&sr=8-6)

Therefore the **Raspberry Pi 4 costs at least 100 Pounds Sterling** when we add the shipping costs.

#### Software
Raspberry Pi 4 runs Linux and there are dozens of distributions to choose from.  You can get a sense of those choices [here](https://raspberrytips.com/best-os-for-raspberry-pi/)

Personally I always use Raspian or now Pi OS and I never had any problems or lack of functionality.

##### Other software
Just having Pi-OS installed would be sufficient for most.  After all it comes with Chromium bundled.  However in practice you need a lot of otherstuff. For example here is a screen shot of me actually writing this article.

Notice I am using Chromium and I have a lot of Chromium extensions active.  You might notice:-

1. LastPass - my password manager;
2. Office365 Online - where I can use Excel, Word, or Powerpoint directly from Chromium;
3. Google Keep - I can snag documents;
4. Google documents - I can launch google drive,  google sheets directly in the Browswer;
5. Autofill - I can fill in forms automatically;
6. Fireshot - allows me to take screen shots from within the Browser.

Out of the Box Chromium is really useful but it is not able to manage Digital Rites and that blocks Netflix,  Spotify, and other streaming services.  So you need to install a different version of Chromium in order to resolve this problem.  [See the article on Toms Hardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/how-to/play-netflix-raspberry-pi) 

Using Chromium with the extensions allows me to open Excel,  Google Sheets,  and even watch Netflix.  Therefore from a Software perspective we are all set.  You can also install recommended Software right from Pi-OS.  Enough said!
