## How much does a Raspberry Pi 4B Computer actually cost
Recently I read quiet a few articles suggesting a **Raspberry Pi computer** is like $35 USD.  I thought really how could that be? 
So naturally I made a Spreadsheet using Office365 Online directly from my Raspberry Pi 4.  Here is what I found!

### What is a computer System
The first thing we need to be really clear on is what we actually mean by a Computer System.  Since that would be somewhat tedious to describe 
I just went out and grabbed the first decent definition I found by asking GOOGLE.

"A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster." [Wikipedia June 7, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)

So we need:-
1. Hardware;
2. Software;
3. Peripheral equipment

#### Hardware
Hardware typically includes an array of components. Here is a typical list:-

1. A computer case or enclosure;
2. A power supply - hopefully matched to the maximum power draw of the full system;
3. A CPU cooler generally speaking a number of fans,  sometimes included in the case;
4. Computer storage - RAID - mSata, SSD, or mechanical drives are all popular;
5. A motherboard or the actual computer board;
6. Increasingly more important is a solid GPU or even multiple GPU with a bridge


The Raspberry Pi 4 motherboard starts at $35 dollars.  That is true but that is just the motherboard.

Typically you need to buy a kit such as the CanaKit shown

[CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 4GB Starter Kit - 4GB RAM](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07XH3HWTQ/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+4b&qid=1591541258&sr=8-6)

Therefore the Raspberry Pi 4 costs at least 100 Pounds Sterling when we add the shipping costs.

#### Software



#### Peripheral Equipment
