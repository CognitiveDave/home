## From Blogging to Video
Having spent time writing on platforms such as Medium and WordPress I have decided to also branch out into Video. Learning how to put together a video is a new experience for me.  To help me learn I created a series ['Technology is Human innovation in Action'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKfduR7k-TQI0MJl209k2A) over on YouTube.

### Technology is Human innovation in action

I guess every show has a show title,  has episodes,  and has opening and closing art work.  I found the opening image using Microsoft PowerPoint.  Buying some music tracks allows me to have an opening and closing theme song.

### Episodes
The plan is to produce a set of videos that explains large projects.  The current project is 'building a sensor network' and I already have the following episodes published with more to come:-

1 [Smart Home - Sensors - Part 1 - DIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvVc7LjmUT0)

2 [sensor build part 2 - Slide show building sensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw3n4q64bIg)

3 [Building the Sensor network - part 2 - Hardware discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGHaCjhOGKQ)

4 [Building the sensor network part 3 - Software Macro level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n4FwgpvXSM)

5 Understanding how to set-up a Sensor - defining a Client Side program

6 Understanding how to set-up a Consumer - and push readings to a database

7 Understanding how to perform Analytics

8 Designing and building a User Interface for the project

9 Bringing the whole project together

10 The closing project retrospective

### Learning to make videos
Since I am learning to make videos the episodes should improve in both narrative and content as I go along.  There is no attempt here to polish or reach perfection.  Perfection is unnecessary in a learning curve.
