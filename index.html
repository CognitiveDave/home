<div class="hello">
    <p> Welcome to my personal website. <br>
        My work career started in 1987 and since then I have had a passion for Financial Systems. Whether we talk about pulling out a set of properly formatted Finanicals or doing remote postings to the General Ledger, I seem to have the same level of enthusiam. 
        Indeed,  as the Financials are core to the organization I have gained tremendous experience with Supply chains and processes such as HR,  Procurement, Manufacturing,  and end to end 
        chains such as Procure to Pay,  Quote to Cash,  Plan to Manufacture right up to Finance.
