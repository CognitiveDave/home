<div class="hello">
    <p> Welcome to my Website. <br> <br>
        My work career started in 1987, and since then, I have had a passion for Financial Systems. 
        Whether we talk about pulling out a set of adequately formatted Financials or doing remote postings to the G/L, 
        I seem to have the same level of enthusiasm. Indeed, as the Financials are core to the organization I have gained 
        tremendous experience with Supply chains and processes such as HR, Procurement, Manufacturing, 
        with end to end chains such as Procure to Pay, Quote to Cash, Plan to Manufacture right up to Finance.  
        I even spent a while in Digital Sales and studied digital selling techniques. <br><br>
        
Working for Thirty Three (33) years seems incredible, and when I look back, it has been a bizarre ride so far.  I always tell the story that at least every five (5) years I have to re-invent myself. The need to stay current has led me to an attitude of life long learning.  10%-20% of each day is for doing Tutorials,  Watching YouTube videos,  reading articles, or doing formal education.

        My site contains a Blog and some pages.  Together the site allows me to share some of the work and insights I have gained over the years. If you find my work interesting, please do reach out.
